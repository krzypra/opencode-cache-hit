/**
 * Drives the REAL published TUI entry the way opencode does: stub the TUI api,
 * call `default.tui(api)`, take the registered `sidebar_content` slot, render
 * it, and click the panel title.
 *
 * Run as a subprocess with `--conditions=browser` (see
 * tests/tui-fold-runtime.test.ts) and with HOME pointed at a temp dir so the
 * user's real cache-hit.json cannot influence the render.
 *
 * Caveat: the opentui test renderer swallows exceptions thrown while rendering
 * or inside click handlers, so a throwing handler is indistinguishable from
 * "no repaint" here. The counter-based proof that the handler really runs lives
 * in tests/fixtures/fold-probe-runner.ts; this runner asserts the user-visible
 * frame change.
 *
 * Usage: bun --conditions=browser tests/fixtures/real-entry-runner.ts <bundle path>
